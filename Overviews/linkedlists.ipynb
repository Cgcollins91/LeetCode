    "- [[Linked Lists]][[pointers]]\n",
    "    - Fast and slow pointers is an implementation of the two pointers technique that we learned in the arrays and strings chapter. The idea is to have two pointers that don't move side by side. This could mean they move at different \"speeds\" during iteration, begin iteration from different locations, or any other abstract difference.\n",
    "    - When the pointers move at different speeds, usually the \"fast\" pointer moves two nodes per iteration, whereas the \"slow\" pointer moves one node per iteration (although this is not always the case). Here's some pseudocode:\n",

    "      // head is the head node of a linked list\n",

    "      ```\n",
    "    - The reason we need the while condition to also check for `fast.next` is because if `fast` is at the final node, then `fast.next` is null, and trying to access `fast.next.next` would result in an error (you would be doing `null.next`).\n",

    "- Sentinel nodes sit at the start and end of linked lists and are used to make operations and the code needed to execute those operations cleaner. The idea is that, even when there are no nodes in a linked list, you still keep pointers to a `head` and `tail`. The real head of the linked list is `head.next` and the real tail is `tail.prev`. The sentinel nodes themselves are not part of our linked list.\n",

    "STACKS\n",
    "- Stacks are LIFO -- elements can only be added and removed from the same end\n",
    "- If we are dealing with logic that requires handling elements in backward order we should think of considering a stack\n",
    "- in python lists are stacks\n",
    "- The time complexity of stack operations is dependent on the implementation. If you use a dynamic array, which is the most common and easiest way, then the time complexity of your operations is the same as that of a dynamic array. __O__(1) push, pop, and random access, and __O__(__n__) search. Sometimes, a stack may be implemented with a linked list with a tail pointer.\n",
    "- The characteristic that makes something a \"stack\" is that you can only add and remove elements from the same end. It doesn't matter how you implement it, a \"stack\" is just an abstract interface.\n",
    "- **Stacks and recursion are very similar. **This is because recursion is actually done using a stack. Function calls are pushed on a stack. The call at the top of the stack at any given moment is the \"active\" call. On a return statement or the end of the function being reached, the current call is popped off the stack.\n"
